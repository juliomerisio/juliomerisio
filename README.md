**Julio here! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a Design Engineer at [Glide](https://glideapps.com), a platform that enables users to create custom apps from  Spreadsheets without coding.
Before joining Glide, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Contra](https://contra.com), building full-stack features.

When I'm not working, you can find me contributing to open source projects, mentoring developers, and building my own projects. I'm enthusiastic about Developer Experience, Motion, and Performance.
