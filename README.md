**Julio here! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a Design Engineer at [Glide](https://glideapps.com), a platform that enables users to create custom mobile apps from Google Sheets without coding.
Before joining Glide, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Contra](https://contra.com), building full-stack features.

When I'm not working, you can find me contributing to open source projects, mentoring junior developers, and building my own projects. I'm enthusiastic about Developer Experience, Motion, and Performance.
